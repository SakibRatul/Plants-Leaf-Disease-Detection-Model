# Plants-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Model

In modern agriculture, the accurate and timely detection of plant diseases is critical for maximizing crop production and promoting sustainable farming practices. This study addresses challenges such as variable environmental conditions, limited computational resources on embedded systems, and the need for real-time detection of plant diseases by developing a mobile robotic system equipped with a custom TensorFlow Lite Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system is designed for the automated detection and quantification of two common tomato plant diseases, powdery mildew (PM) and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), in open-field cultivation. By employing data augmentation techniques to enhance robustness under diverse environmental conditions and optimizing the CNN architecture for resource-constrained devices, the system achieves an impressive 91.00% accuracy in disease detection using a dataset of 2,900 custom images collected from various tomato farms. Additionally, the systemâ€™s ability to quantify disease severity provides actionable insights, empowering farmers to implement timely and targeted interventions. Unlike traditional fixed sensor-based detection systems, this mobile robotic solution offers real-time, autonomous disease monitoring in open-field environments, significantly improving operational efficiency. The research demonstrates the transformative potential of deep learning-enabled mobile robots for plant disease management, paving the way for increased crop yields, reduced pesticide usage, and more sustainable agricultural practices.
